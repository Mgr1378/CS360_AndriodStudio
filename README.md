## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
> The app that I developed for this course was an Inventory Tracking App.

### User Requirements and Goals
1. Keep data secure by requiring login
2. Track all items that are in the inventory
3. Add or Remove items from inventory when required
4. Change number of items in inventory if required
5. Notify user when inventory has been reduced to 0
6. Display all inventory
 
 > The goals listed above will be the main purpose of the app. We will keep the data secure by requiring the user to login
 > to the system before they are able to see any of the information. We will keep track of all new and old inventory, if 
 > it has not been removed from the list. We will notify the user if or when an item has been reduced to 0 so they can 
 > order more of that item as soon as possible. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
1. Login screen
2.	Create login screen
3.	Main screen
4.	Add, Change, or Remove screen
5.	Display inventory screen
> When loading the app, the first screen any user will see is the login screen, where they will be asked for their login information. If the user does not
> have a login, they can create one by clicking the create new login button which will take them to a new screen to complete the login creation. Once the 
> user is logged in, they will be taken to the main screen that will contain a list of buttons that they are allowed to see by the admin. If the user is 
> allowed to see all the buttons, they will see buttons that will allow them to Add, Change, Remove, or Display items in the inventory. Once a user selects
> the action, they wish to perform the app will open a new screen that will allow the user to continue with the action that they have selected. 
> For example, if the user was to select the Add item button, the screen would change to allow the user to add an item to the inventory, on this screen
> to user would be asked for information about the item they wish to add to inventory, such as name of item, description of item, how many of the item 
> they have on hand. After the user answers all the questions about the new item there will be to buttons at the button of the screen that ask the user 
> if they would like to save the item or cancel the request to add new item. That will be the same basic layout for the change item button and the remove
> item button. The display all button will take the user to a new screen that will display all the inventory with the quantity of each item that is in the
> inventory. And at anytime the user can press the menu button at the top left-hand side of any screen for a drop-down menu to move from screen to screen
> with out having to move back to the main page. The upper right-hand side of every screen will contain a logout button for when the user wants to logout.



## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
> The approach that I took to complete this project was alot of trial and error, along with many Google searches, and Youtube videos, that helped me
> learn the things that I needed in order to complete the app. I will be able to use the same techniques in the future while I am trying to find 
> documentation on other things that I need to complete.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
> For this project, I used manual testing by running my app through the Emulator inside of Android Studio, to ensure that all of the features in my
> app where working in the order that I wanted them to. I know that it would have been faster and more efficient to automate the testing process
> but with this being my fisrt app I wanted to manually test my app. 
> The reason that the testing process is important is that it can reveal mistakes that maybe in the code before you release it to the public.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
> The part of the process that was a challenge for me was the design stage, when it comes to designing I have to do, is what I would consider more research then what other people may have to do before I can fully commit to a design that I like.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
> I would have to say that one area that I was particularly successful at was in coding the backend of the app. Being able to get my app to move from screen to screen the way that it should.
